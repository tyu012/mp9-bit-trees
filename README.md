## Purpose
To use bit trees to convert between ASCII, a binary representation of braille,
and Unicode Braille characters.

## How to run
```
java BrailleASCII <targetCharSet> <source>
```

where `<targetCharSet>` is the target character set:
* `braille` for converting from ASCII to binary Braille
* `ascii` for converting from binary Braille to ASCII
* `unicode` for converting from ASCII to Unicode Braille

and `<source>` is the characters you want to convert.
